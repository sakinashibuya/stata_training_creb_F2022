\title{Coding for Reproducible Research \\ Making Tables in Stata and Latex}

\section{Introduction}

Over the next two courses (one hour each), we will learn how to make your research more reproducible. \\

Today, we are going to focus on making reproducible tables using Stata and Latex, while we learn some tricks for better collaboration and code organizations. \\

In this lecture, I'm assuming the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You have Stata, Latex, and an Latex editor installed in your device.
	\item You are already familiar and somewhat comfortable with coding in Stata and Latex.
	\item You feel comfotable reading Stata help files.
\end{itemize}

My code has a lot of explanations. If you are unfamiliar with Stata and/or Latex, I hope they are helpful.

\section{Tricks for Easier Collaboration}

It's rarely the case that we work on a research project all on our own. \\ 

When you have co-authors, it's extremely important that the work each team member does is shared with others in a timely as well as organized manner. \\ 

One amazing tool we can use is Git. We will learn about this on next Wednesday (Oct. 26th). \\

Today I want show you how I make mine as well as my co-authors lives less miserable in Stata. \\

\subsection{Master do-files}

We often have multiple do-files to complete one task (e.g. conducting a robustness check). \\ 

To make sure that all do-files associated with a particular task are easily recognizable by my team mates, I often write a master do file. \\ 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Example Folder Structure with a Master Do File}

	\label{fig:examplefolder}
\end{figure}
	

\subsection{Do-files Executable by All Your Team Members}

It's very important that your code is executable by your team members. \\ 

For this to be possible, they have to have proper access to input (i.e. data) and 
code. \\

One way to make your code executable by others is to have a "housekeeping" section as the following.
This one is from a project I'm working on with Zunia. \\ 

Notice that I have the following sections:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item User identification
	\item File directories
	\item Sections
	\item User-written commands
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{User identification} identifies your device and set folder paths to the folders shared by all the team members. \\

\textbf{File directories} make it clear where things are. \\

\textbf{Sections} provide a map for this current do file. \\

\textbf{User-written commands} make sure that everyone has all the necessary commands installed to run your code.

\begin{stlog}\input{instructions_1.log.tex}\end{stlog}

\section{Making Reproducible Tables}

We are going to use an example dataset that comes with Stata, called \textbf{nlswork.dta}. \\

If you want to know a bit about this dataset, simply

\begin{stlog}\input{instructions_2.log.tex}\end{stlog}
We need to make one variable and change tha labels of two existing variables for our exercise. \\
\begin{stlog}\input{instructions_3.log.tex}\end{stlog}
\subsection{Making Tables with outreg2}

Suppose we are interested in understanding the relationships between wage and working hours (dependent variables), and education, race, and region in US in which respondents reside (independent variables). \\

We want to output the results into one table. \\

The easiest command for this purpose is probably \textit{outreg2}. \\

So we can run the following code. \\

\begin{stlog}\input{instructions_4.log.tex}\end{stlog}

This command produces the following table. \\

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\adjustbox{max width=\textwidth}{
	\input{regs_outreg2.tex}
	}
\end{table}


This is fine for quick outputting, but it's very hard to read. \\

We also probably don't really need to show all estimates. \\

Let's say that we are only interested in the interacted terms for the purpose of this exercise. \\

The following table is much easier to read and looks more professional. \\

\input{regs_estout.tex} 


Once we start thinking about more customization, we git the limitations of \textit{outreg2} quickly. \\

How can we make this table? \\
\newpage
\subsection{Making tables with estout and texdoc}

We can use \textit{estout} and \textit{texdoc} to achieve this. \\


\textbf{\textit{estout}} is a flexible command for outputting a table. \\

You can do all kinds of customization, although it can get pretty complicated. \\

I like to combined \textit{estout} and \textbf{\textit{texdoc}} to make my life a bit easier withouth compromizing on customizabiliy. \\


I won't really go deep into explaining \textit{texdoc}, because there is a very nice insturction on the web \href{http://repec.sowi.unibe.ch/stata/texdoc/getting-started.html}{by Ben Jann}. \\

I just note a couple of things.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The code that produces a tex file must be called from another do-file using the command \textit{textdoc do}.
	\item You also need to have \textit{stata.sty} in the same folder to complile the tex file.
\end{itemize}

Here is the code to do this. \\

\begin{stlog}\input{instructions_5.log.tex}\end{stlog}

After this part, you have to call the do file that writes out a whole tex file that companies \textit{Panel A} and \textit{Panel B} in a special way using the command, \textbf{\textit{texdoc do}} as the following: \\

\begin{verbatim}
texdoc do "\$dofiles/analysis/table\_regs\_estout.do"
\end{verbatim}


And this is what's inside of this do-file. \\


\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Inside \textit{table\_regs\_estout.do}}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example_texdoc}
	\label{fig:exampletexdoc}
\end{figure}


This is the end of today's class. \\


Next time, we will cover how to use Git with Github. \\


Any questions and concerns?
